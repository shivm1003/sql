SELECT * FROM market_fact_full
SELECT * FROM orders_dimen
SELECT * FROM prod_dimen
SELECT * FROM shipping_dimen


-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:




-- Now as you can see four columns of the movie table has null values. Let's look at the at the movies released each year. 
-- Q3. Find the total number of movies released each year? How does the trend look month wise? (Output expected)
